Mouse hover animation inspired by the Apple TV UI. The animation uses css and javascript to programmatically track the position of the mouse inside the card div and using that position animate the rotation with respect to the y and x axis. The gloss is a div inside the card called the highlight that animates its top and left position with respect to mouse position.
