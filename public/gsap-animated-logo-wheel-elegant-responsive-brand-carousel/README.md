GSAP Animated Circular Logo Wheel 

Spotted a rotating logo wheel online somewhere and wanted to recreate the effect so it was responsive and logos could be added and removed easily.

 Built with GSAP for precision motion and performance, it supports hover tooltips,clickable links, and adjustabl speed or direction through simple data attributes.

 Designed to be fully responsive, the wheel automatically scales its size and spacing across devices — from large desktop displays to compact mobile screens. When logos are added or removed, the script recalculates positions evenly around the circle, maintaining perfect symmetry and balance with no manual adjustments needed.
